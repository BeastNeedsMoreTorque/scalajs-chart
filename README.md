# scalajs-google-maps
Type-safe and Scala-friendly library over Chart.js.

## Dependency Info
[Scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org/).

[ChartJS](http://www.chartjs.org/)

## Get started
I assume that you have setup a ScalaJS project before.  If this is not the case you can follow the instructions and some basic example on the [Scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org/) homepage.


### Include Chart.js on your page
```html
 <script src="Chart.js"></script>
```
Or better yet... if you are using WebJAR you can simply include the following line in your build.sbt
```sbt
"org.webjars"                 % "chartjs"              % "26962ce-1"
```

### Build.sbt
Add the following dependency to your porject.

`"io.surfkit" %%% "scalajs-chart" % "0.1-SNAPSHOT",`

## Some Examples
Here are some of the Chartjs examples demonstrated in a type safe scalaJS way.

### TODO
Initialize ...
```scala
object todo{

}
```
